  abstract = {We analyze the quantum trajectory dynamics of free fermions subject to continuous monitoring. For weak monitoring, we identify a novel dynamical regime of subextensive entanglement growth, reminiscent of a critical phase with an emergent conformal invariance. For strong monitoring, however, the dynamics favors a transition into a quantum Zeno-like area-law regime. Close to the critical point, we observe logarithmic finite size corrections, indicating a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism underlying the transition. This uncovers an unconventional entanglement transition in an elementary, physically realistic model for weak continuous measurements. In addition, we demonstrate that the measurement aspect in the dynamics is crucial for whether or not a phase transition takes place.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy S and the Fisher information F, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities S(n) and F(n) that depend on the nth moments of density matrices and reduce to S and F in the limit n\textrightarrow 1. These quantities with n{$\geq$}2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with n! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, S(n) is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and F(n) is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension q followed by the replica limit n\textrightarrow 1, we obtain the critical measurement probability pc=1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.},

In this context a quantum filtering theory has been developed giving the reduced state after a measurement when a certain trajectory of the measured observables is registered (the a posteriori states). In this paper a new derivation of filtering equations is presented for the cases of counting processes and of measurement processes of diffusive type. It is also shown that the equation for the a posteriori dynamics in the diffusive case can be obtained, by a suitable limit, from that in the counting case. Moreover, the paper is intended to clarify the meaning of the various concepts involved and to discuss the connections among them. As an illustration of the theory, simple models are worked out.}

  abstract = {Competition between unitary dynamics that scrambles quantum information nonlocally and local measurements that probe and collapse the quantum state can result in a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition. Here we study this phenomenon in an analytically tractable all-to-all Brownian hybrid circuit model composed of qubits. The system is initially entangled with an equal sized reference, and the subsequent hybrid system dynamics either partially preserves or totally destroys this entanglement depending on the measurement rate. Our approach can access a variety of entropic observables which are distinguished by the averaging procedure, and for concreteness we focus on a particular purity quantity for which the averaging is particularly simple. We represent the purity as a path integral coupling four replicas with twisted boundary conditions. Saddle-point analysis reveals a second-order phase transition corresponding to replica permutation symmetry breaking below a critical measurement rate. The transition is mean-field-like and we characterize the critical properties near the transition in terms of a simple Ising field theory in 0+1 dimensions. In addition to studying the purity of the entire system, we study subsystem purities and relate these results to manifestations of quantum error correction in the model. We also comment on the experimental feasibility for simulating this averaged purity, and corroborate our results with exact diagonalization for modest system sizes.},

Here we show that for a many-body system evolving under competing unitary evolution and variable-strength measurements the onset of the Zeno effect takes the form of a sharp phase transition. Using the Quantum Ising chain with continuous monitoring of the transverse magnetization as paradigmatic example we show that for weak measurements the entanglement produced by the unitary dynamics remains protected, and actually enhanced by the monitoring, while only above a certain threshold the system is sharply brought into an uncorrelated Zeno state. We show that this transition is invisible to the average dynamics, but encoded in the rare fluctuations of the stochastic measurement process, which we show to be perfectly captured by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which takes the form of a Quantum Ising model in an imaginary valued transverse field. We provide analytical results based on the fermionization of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in supports of our exact numerical calculations.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical work has shown that the competition between coherent unitary dynamics and stochastic measurements, performed by the environment, along wave function trajectories can give rise to transitions in the entanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we analyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is reversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled phase of a quantum spin-12 chain, while competing single-particle or interacting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the single-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an entanglement transition from a logarithmic growth with system size to an area law when the competition ratio between the unitary evolution and the nonunitary dynamics increases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent observables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement dynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state dynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative dynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any nonvanishing Hamiltonian contribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In addition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the entanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition. Complementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent dynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the entanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results suggest that this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians, underlining its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.},

  abstract = {A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we perform heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zeropoint fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative verification of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence field quadratures, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.},

This model displays two stable phases, characterized by the volume-law and area-law scaling entanglement entropy in steady states. The transition between the two phases is understood from the point of view of quantum error correction: the chaotic unitary evolution protects quantum information from projective measurements that act as errors. A phase transition occurs when the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that depends on the degree of information scrambling. We confirm these results using numerical simulations and obtain the phase diagram of our model.

By adding a finite but very small perturbation in the form of a random matrix, it is shown that the results of quantum statistical mechanics are recovered. Expectation values in energy eigenstates for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the number of degrees of freedom.}

The method is applied to one-dimensional chains of nearest-neighbor interacting hard-core bosons. A transition from an entangling to a disentangling (area-law) phase is found. However, by resolving time-dependent density correlations in the monitored system, we find important differences between different regions at the phase boundary. In particular, we observe a peculiar phenomenon of measurement-induced particle clusterization that takes place only for frequent moderately strong measurements, but not for strong infrequent measurements.},

  abstract = {Random measurements have been shown to induce a phase transition in an extended quantum system evolving under chaotic unitary dynamics, when the strength of measurements exceeds a threshold value. Below this threshold, a steady state with a subthermal volume law entanglement emerges, which is resistant to the disentangling action of measurements, suggesting a connection to quantum error-correcting codes. We quantify these notions by identifying a power-law decay of the mutual information I(\{x\}:\=A){$\propto$}x-3/2 in the volume-law-entangled phase, between a qudit located a distance x from the boundary of a region A, and the complement \=A, which implies that a measurement of this qudit will retrieve very little information about \=A. We also find a universal logarithmic contribution to the volume law entanglement entropy S(2)(A)={$\kappa$}LA+32logLA which is intimately related to the first observation. We obtain these results by relating the entanglement dynamics to the imaginary time evolution of an Ising model, to which we apply field-theoretic and matrix-product-state techniques. Finally, exploiting the error-correction viewpoint, we assume that the volume-law state is an encoding of a Page state in a quantum error-correcting code to obtain a bound on the critical measurement strength pc as a function of the qudit dimension d: pclog[(d2-1)(pc-1-1)]{$\leq$}log[(1-pc)d]. The bound is saturated at pc(d\textrightarrow{$\infty$})=1/2 and provides a reasonable estimate for the qubit transition: pc(d=2){$\leq$}0.1893.},

We find the signatures of the transitions as peak structures in the mutual information as a function of measurement strength, as previously reported for random unitary circuits with projective measurements. At the transition points, the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically and various physical quantities scale algebraically, implying emergent conformal criticality, for both integrable and nonintegrable one-dimensional interacting Hamiltonians; however, such transitions have been argued to be absent in noninteracting regimes in some previous studies. With the aid of U(1) symmetry in our model, the measurement-induced criticality exhibits a spectral signature resembling a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory from symmetry-resolved entanglement. These intriguing critical phenomena are unique to steady-state regimes of the conditional dynamics at the single-trajectory level and are absent in the unconditional dynamics obeying the Lindblad master equation, in which the system ends up with the featureless, infinite-temperature mixed state. We also propose a possible experimental setup to test the predicted entanglement transition based on the subsystem particle-number fluctuations. This quantity should readily be measured by the current techniques of quantum gas microscopy and is in practice easier to obtain than the entanglement entropy itself.},

The advantages of the numerical solution of these equations over the direct numerical solution of the density operator equations are described. The method is applied to the nonlinear absorber, cascades of quantum transitions, second-harmonic generation and a measurement reduction process. The model provides graphic illustrations of these processes, with statistical fluctuations that mimic those of experiments. The stochastic differential equations originated from studies of the measurement problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics. The model is compared with the quantum-jump model of Dalibard (1992), Carmichael and others, which originated among experimenters looking for intuitive pictures and rules of computation.}

  abstract = {Continuously monitoring the environment of a quantum many-body system reduces the entropy of (purifies) the reduced density matrix of the system, conditional on the outcomes of the measurements. We show that, for mixed initial states, a balanced competition between measurements and entangling interactions within the system can result in a dynamical purification phase transition between (i) a phase that locally purifies at a constant system-size-independent rate and (ii) a "mixed"phase where the purification time diverges exponentially in the system size. The residual entropy density in the mixed phase implies the existence of a quantum error-protected subspace, where quantum information is reliably encoded against the future nonunitary evolution of the system. We show that these codes are of potential relevance to fault-tolerant quantum computation as they are often highly degenerate and satisfy optimal trade-offs between encoded information densities and error thresholds. In spatially local models in 1+1 dimensions, this phase transition for mixed initial states occurs concurrently with a recently identified class of entanglement phase transitions for pure initial states. The purification transition studied here also generalizes to systems with long-range interactions, where conventional notions of entanglement transitions have to be reformulated. We numerically explore this transition for monitored random quantum circuits in 1+1 dimensions and all-to-all models. Unlike in pure initial states, the mutual information of an initially completely mixed state in 1+1 dimensions grows sublinearly in time due to the formation of the error-protected subspace. Purification dynamics is likely a more robust probe of the transition in experiments, where imperfections generically reduce entanglement and drive the system towards mixed states. We describe the motivations for studying this novel class of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in the context of advanced quantum computing platforms and fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

  abstract = {Random quantum circuits have played a central role in establishing the computational advantages of near-term quantum computers over their conventional counterparts. Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local connectivity in spatial dimensions to generate quantum error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we find strong evidence that a depth random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel capacity, for any . Previous results on random circuits have only shown that depth suffices or that depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity (). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with . We find that the requisite depth scales like only for dimensions and that random circuits require depth for . Finally, we introduce an ``expurgation'' algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into either additional stabilizers or into gauge operators in a subsystem code. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sublogarithmic depth in spatial dimensions below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in dimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are practically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the resource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory provides an extensive framework for the description of the equilibrium properties of quantum matter. Yet experiments in quantum simulators have now opened up a route towards the generation of quantum states beyond this equilibrium paradigm. While these states promise to show properties not constrained by equilibrium principles, such as the equal a priori probability of the microcanonical ensemble, identifying the general properties of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a major challenge, especially in view of the lack of conventional concepts such as free energies. The theory of dynamical quantum phase transitions attempts to identify such general principles by lifting the concept of phase transitions to coherent quantum real-time evolution. This review provides a pedagogical introduction to this field. Starting from the general setting of nonequilibrium dynamics in closed quantum many-body systems, we give the definition of dynamical quantum phase transitions as phase transitions in time with physical quantities becoming nonanalytic at critical times. We summarize the achieved theoretical advances as well as the first experimental observations, and furthermore provide an outlook to major open questions as well as future directions of research.},

While the unitary gates are drawn from a random distribution and act uniformly in the circuit, the measurements are made at random positions and times throughout the system. By varying the measurement rate we can tune between the volume law entangled phase for the random unitary circuit model (no measurements) and a "quantum Zeno phase" where strong measurements suppress the entanglement growth to saturate in an area law. Extensive numerical simulations of the quantum trajectories of the many-particle wave functions (exploiting Clifford circuitry to access systems up to 512 qubits) provide evidence for a stable "weak measurement phase" that exhibits volume-law entanglement entropy, with a coefficient decreasing with increasing measurement rate. We also present evidence for a continuous quantum dynamical phase transition between the "weak measurement phase" and the "quantum Zeno phase," driven by a competition between the entangling tendencies of unitary evolution and the disentangling tendencies of projective measurements. Detailed steady-state and dynamic critical properties of this quantum entanglement transition are accessed.},

We simulate a large class of Clifford circuits, including models with or without randomness in the unitary gates, and with or without randomness in the locations of measurement gates, using stabilizer techniques to access the long-time dynamics of systems up to 512 qubits. In all models we find a volume-law entangled phase for low measurement rates, which exhibits a subdominant logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy, SA={$\alpha$}ln|A|+s|A|, with subsystem size |A|. With increasing measurement rate the volume-law phase is unstable to a disentangled area-law phase, passing through a single entanglement transition at a critical rate of measurement. At criticality we find a purely logarithmic entanglement entropy, SA={$\alpha$}(pc)ln|A|, a power-law decay and conformal symmetry of the mutual information, with exponential decay off criticality. Various spin-spin correlation functions also show slow decay at criticality. Critical exponents are consistent across all models, indicative of a single universality class. These results suggest the existence of an effective underlying statistical mechanical model for the entanglement transition. Beyond Clifford circuit models, numerical simulations of up to 20 qubits give consistent results.},

Building upon (1) a general formula relating the error susceptibility of a subregion to its entanglement properties, and (2) a previously established mapping between entanglement entropies and domain wall free energies of an underlying spin model, we propose a statistical mechanical description of the QECC in terms of "entanglement domain walls."Free energies of such domain walls generically feature a leading volume law term coming from its "surface energy,"and a subvolume law correction coming from thermodynamic entropies of its transverse fluctuations. These are most easily accounted for by capillary-wave theory of liquid-gas interfaces, which we use as an illustrative tool. We show that the information-theoretic decoupling criterion corresponds to a geometric decoupling of domain walls, which further leads to the identification of the "contiguous code distance"of the QECC as the crossover length scale at which the energy and entropy of the domain wall are comparable. The contiguous code distance thus diverges with the system size as the subleading entropic term of the free energy, protecting a finite code rate against local undetectable errors. We support these correspondences with numerical evidence, where we find capillary-wave theory describes many qualitative features of the QECC; we also discuss when and why it fails to do so.},

  abstract = {Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for example, after a quantum quench, is a key problem in nonequilibrium quantum physics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the ``entanglement tsunami'' in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like (time)1/3 and are spatially correlated over a distance {$\propto$}(time)2/3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a ``minimal cut'' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the ``velocity'' of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.},

  abstract = {Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, which are able to capture, for example, universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC and determines the butterfly speed vB. We find that in 1+1D, the ``front'' of the OTOC broadens diffusively, with a width scaling in time as t1/2. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front within a realization. Turning to higher dimensions, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a purely classical droplet growth problem. This implies that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as t1/3 in 2+1D and as t0.240 in 3+1D (exponents of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in two or higher spatial dimensions, the shape of the spreading operator at late times is affected by underlying lattice symmetries and, in general, is not spherical. However, when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic form for the OTOC, in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like statistical mechanics model. As a result of special structure arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.},

Quantum circuits composed of random unitary gates with interspersed projective measurements represent a minimal model to study the balance between unitary dynamics and measurement processes3\textendash 5. As the measurement rate is varied, a purification phase transition is predicted to emerge at a critical point akin to a fault-tolerant threshold6. Here we explore this purification transition with random quantum circuits implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer. We probe the pure phase, where the system is rapidly projected to a pure state conditioned on the measurement outcomes, and the mixed or coding phase, where the initial state becomes partially encoded into a quantum error correcting codespace that keeps the memory of initial conditions for long times6,7. We find experimental evidence of the two phases and show numerically that, with modest system scaling, critical properties of the transition emerge. Many-body open quantum systems are predicted to undergo a phase transition towards a pure state through frequent projective measurements. The phases separated by this transition have now been observed with random circuits on a trapped-ion computer.},

  abstract = {Dissipation, the irreversible loss of energy and coherence, from a microsystem is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or reservoir) that is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states, which results in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation used density matrices to describe an ensemble of microsystems, either in the Schr\"odinger picture with master equations, or in the Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example, single trapped ions, or cavity-radiation-field modes) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel. These methods, variously described as quantum-jump, Monte Carlo wave function, and quantum-trajectory methods, are the subject of this review article. We discuss their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics, and relate them to ensemble descriptions.},

  abstract = {The scrambling of quantum information in closed many-body systems, as measured by out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs), has received considerable attention lately. Recently, a hydrodynamical description of OTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits. Numerical work suggests that aspects of this description are universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without randomness; a conjectured explanation for this is that while the random circuits have noise built into them, deterministic quantum systems, much like classically chaotic ones, ``generate their own noise'' and look effectively random on sufficient length scales and timescales. In this paper, we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved quantities (e.g., energy). We do this by considering local random unitary circuits with a conserved U(1) charge and argue, with numerical and analytical evidence, that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation in both time-ordered and out-of-time-ordered correlation functions; both can have a diffusively relaxing component or ``hydrodynamic tail'' at late times. We verify the presence of such tails also in a deterministic, periodically driven system. We show that for OTOCs, the combination of diffusive and ballistic components leads to a wave front with a specific asymmetric shape, decaying as a power law behind the front. These results also explain existing numerical investigations in non-noisy ergodic systems with energy conservation. Moreover, we consider OTOCs in Gibbs states, parametrized by a chemical potential {$\mu$}, and apply perturbative arguments to show that for {$\mu\gg$}1 the ballistic front of information spreading can only develop at times exponentially large in {$\mu$}\textemdash with the information traveling diffusively at earlier times. We also develop a new formalism for describing OTOCs and operator spreading, which allows us to interpret the saturation of OTOCs as a form of thermalization on the Hilbert space of operators.},

  abstract = {We define dynamical universality classes for many-body systems whose unitary evolution is punctuated by projective measurements. In cases where such measurements occur randomly at a finite rate p for each degree of freedom, we show that the system has two dynamical phases: "entangling" and "disentangling." The former occurs for p smaller than a critical rate pc and is characterized by volume-law entanglement in the steady state and "ballistic" entanglement growth after a quench. By contrast, for p{$>$}pc the system can sustain only area-law entanglement. At p=pc the steady state is scale invariant, and in 1+1D, the entanglement grows logarithmically after a quench. To obtain a simple heuristic picture for the entangling-disentangling transition, we first construct a toy model that describes the zeroth R\'enyi entropy in discrete time. We solve this model exactly by mapping it to an optimization problem in classical percolation. The generic entangling-disentangling transition can be diagnosed using the von Neumann entropy and higher R\'enyi entropies, and it shares many qualitative features with the toy problem. We study the generic transition numerically in quantum spin chains and show that the phenomenology of the two phases is similar to that of the toy model but with distinct "quantum" critical exponents, which we calculate numerically in 1+1D. We examine two different cases for the unitary dynamics: Floquet dynamics for a nonintegrable Ising model, and random circuit dynamics. We obtain compatible universal properties in each case, indicating that the entangling-disentangling phase transition is generic for projectively measured many-body systems. We discuss the significance of this transition for numerical calculations of quantum observables in many-body systems.},

We demonstrate this effect for a one-dimensional quantum circuit evolving under random unitary transformations and generic positive operator-valued measurements of variable strength. As opposed to projective measurements describing a restricted class of open systems, the measuring device is modeled as a continuous Gaussian probe, capturing a large class of environments. By employing data collapse and studying the enhanced fluctuations at the transition, we obtain a consistent phase boundary in the space of the measurement strength and the measurement probability, clearly demonstrating a critical value of the measurement strength below which the system is always ergodic, irrespective of the measurement probability. These findings provide guidance for quantum engineering of many-body systems by controlling their environment.},

abstract = {In an entangled many-particle system, changing the state of one constituent affects the rest of the system. This property can be used as a resource in quantum information processing, but getting many particles to participate in entanglement is tricky. Luo et al. used another collective phenomenon, a quantum phase transition, to entangle more than 900 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The size of the entangled ensemble remained stable, making the approach practical for precision measurements. Science, this issue p. 620 A large entangled 87Rb atom ensemble robust to number fluctuations was created. Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting particles. These very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock condensate of ~11,000 atoms by driving a rubidium-87 Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing spin mixing through two consecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.}}

abstract = {Parts of a quantum system can be more “correlated” than what is allowed in the everyday classical world: A measurement on one part of the system can immediately affect a spatially distant component. The strongest of such correlations, Bell correlations, have been detected in small systems containing two to a handful of particles. Schmied et al. used collective measurements to detect Bell correlations among the spins of 480 Rb atoms cooled to a condensed state. This many-body correlated state may be useful as a resource in quantum information processing. Science, this issue p. 441 Strong quantum correlations are detected among the spins of 480 rubidium atoms in a condensed state. Characterizing many-body systems through the quantum correlations between their constituent particles is a major goal of quantum physics. Although entanglement is routinely observed in many systems, we report here the detection of stronger correlations—Bell correlations—between the spins of about 480 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive a Bell correlation witness from a many-particle Bell inequality involving only one- and two-body correlation functions. Our measurement on a spin-squeezed state exceeds the threshold for Bell correlations by 3.8 standard deviations. Our work shows that the strongest possible nonclassical correlations are experimentally accessible in many-body systems and that they can be revealed by collective measurements.}}

  abstract = {In recent years, quantum phase transitions have attracted the interest of both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behaviour of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions is boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed at bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview on a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.},

  abstract = {Thermalization and scrambling are the subject of much recent study from the perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces (``spin chains''), quantum field theory, and holography. We tackle this problem in 1D spin chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by a ``hydrodynamical'' equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy). In this hydrodynamic picture, quantum information travels in a front with a ``butterfly velocity'' vB that is smaller than the light-cone velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time. The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do not observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form {$\sim$}e{$\lambda$}L(t-x/v) for a fixed Lyapunov exponent {$\lambda$}L. We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the hydrodynamical description applies to more generic Floquet ergodic systems, and we support this idea by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator wavefront also holds in a more traditional nonrandom Floquet spin chain. We also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.},

A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSEs with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed. \textcopyright{} 1993 The American Physical Society.}

We apply this theory to a system with nonclassical dynamics, a sub-Poissonian pumped laser. By using the feedback to phase lock the laser it is possible to produce output light which exhibits perfect quadrature squeezing on resonance, rather than just sub-Poissonian intensity statistics. However, we also show that feedback mediated by homodyne detection (or any other extracavity measurement) cannot produce nonclassical light unless the cavity dynamics can do so without feedback. Furthermore, in systems which already exhibit squeezing, such feedback can only degrade the squeezing in the output. With feedback mediated by an intracavity measurement, these theorems do not apply. We show that an (admittedly unrealistic) intracavity quantum nondemolition quadrature measurement allows arbitrary squeezing to be produced by controlling the amplitude of a coherent driving field.},

Second, a spatial scan of the microscope acts to map out the spatial density of stationary quantum states. Remarkably, in the latter case, for a good cavity limit, the microscope becomes an effective quantum nondemolition device, such that the spatial distribution of motional eigenstates can be measured backaction free in single scans, as an emergent quantum nondemolition measurement.},

Our estimates of the surface order parameter exponent appear different from those for stabilizer circuits or percolation, but we cannot definitively rule out the scenario where all exponents in the three cases match. Moreover, in the Haar case the prefactor for the entanglement entropies Sn depends strongly on the R\'enyi index n; for stabilizer circuits and percolation this dependence is absent. Results on stabilizer circuits are used to guide our study and identify measures with weak finite-size effects. We discuss how our numerical estimates constrain theories of the transition.},

  abstract = {We investigate theoretically the suppression of two-body losses when the on-site loss rate is larger than all other energy scales in a lattice. This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature (London) 501, 521 (2013)]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us to show that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling fraction by a factor of 5. A rate equation can describe much of the data, but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Physical Society.},
